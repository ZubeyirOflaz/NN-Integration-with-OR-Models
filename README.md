# NN-Integration-with-OR-Models
Initial research on Integrating neural networks with optimization research models
## Steps Planned
1. Create script that is a cursory representation of traffic (done)
2. Train a neural network on the dummy data to predict the travel time between locations (done)
3. Understand how OR models work in Pyomo, create a travelling salesman model
4. Integrate the neural network the the OR model for travel time predictions
5. Find out how to integrate neural networks to a Minizinc Model
